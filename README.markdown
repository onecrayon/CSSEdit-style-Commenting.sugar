# CSSEdit-style Commenting.sugar

This Sugar adds a new **Actions&rarr;New CSSEdit-style Comment** command to Espresso when working with CSS that will insert a new comment at your cursor (if outside of a selector block) or after the current selector block. You can also use the shortcut `command shift option /`.

## Installation

**Requires Espresso 2**

The easiest way to install Seesaw.sugar currently is directly from GitHub:

    cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Espresso/Sugars
    git clone git://github.com/onecrayon/CSSEdit-style-Commenting.sugar.git

Relaunch Espresso to use the new action.

Alternately, you can [download the project](https://github.com/onecrayon/CSSEdit-style-Commenting.sugar/zipball/master), decompress it, rename the resulting folder "CSSEdit-style Commenting.sugar" (or whatever you prefer), and double click it to install.
